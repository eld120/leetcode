#Problem solving practice

I spend too much time messing around locally without any documented proof of time spent on improving/expanding my problem solving skills. This repo's only purpose is to document the number of times I've worked on the following:
-DS/algorithms
-ideal use of python/javascript
-regular expressions
-functional programming


more to come...
